# Simon

This version of Simon aims to improve your short-term memory. To win this game, you have to remember a pattern of 10 colors.

Why 10?

In 1956, Harvard psychology professor George Miller published a study stating the average number of objects an average human can hold in their short-term memory is 7 plus/minus 2. According to this, the average human can hold between 5 and 9 items in their short-term memory. So reaching 10 in this game of Simon means your short-term memory is better than the average human.

## Getting Started

As a player, you will follow the pattern Simon creates each round.

To start the game, Simon will press one square to start a new pattern. If the player matches the square correctly, Simon will increase the difficulty by adding a square to the pattern to increase the complexity.

The player is awarded one point each time the player gets the pattern right. To win the game the player has to match Simon's pattern 10 times in a row. The game is over if the player gets the pattern wrong.
